0.13.1 (2024-09-27)
-------------------

Forthcoming
-----------
* Update Jenkinsfile to use the jammy docker image (`#9 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/ros1_bridge/issues/9>`_)
  * Update Jenkinsfile to use the jammy docker image
  * Package wide linting fixes
  CPP, CMake, python, etc. Mostly updated using tools, some manual
  edits.
* Remove upstream github actions that fail (`#8 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/ros1_bridge/issues/8>`_)
  We probably shouldn't be running our proprietary code on an upstream
  CI anyways so remove this action.
* Whitelist packages (`#6 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/ros1_bridge/issues/6>`_)
  * Introduces package include and exclude lists
  * Adds cmake file that parses package include resp. exclude list
  * Filtering cmake dependencies based on include/exclude list
  https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/issues/284
  Co-authored-by: James Prestwood <jprestwood@locusrobotics.com>
  * Passes package incl./excl. to bridge generation
  * CMake passes package include/ignore lists to python scripts generating
  the bridge c++ code
  * Generation of factories and mappings restricted to packages filtered
  by include/ignore lists
  https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/issues/284
  Co-authored-by: James Prestwood <jprestwood@locusrobotics.com>
  * Create package whitelist from package.xml
  The prior mechanism to generate an ignore/include list was to
  use a static file at the workspace root. This doesn't play very
  well with our build system so instead use package.xml. Any
  <build_depend> package will now be included in the ros1_bridge
  build.
  This is done using a simple python script to parse package.xml
  which is then called by cmake (stdout of the script is the list).
  We then feed that list into a modified filter_packages() function
  that takes a list of include/ignore packages rather than using
  the static list.
  * Replace rosidl_cmake with rosidl_common
  The former is deprecated and the build was warning of this.

* [master] Update maintainers - 2022-11-07 (#386)
* Apply automatic mapping rules in case only package+message mapping exists (#382)
  * Fix message mapping by removing early return so other rules can still be applied
  In determine_field_mapping, there was an early return inside a loop over all mapping rules.
  IF there we any mapping rules but they don't specify field mappings, the early return made the function return without creating mappings automatically.
  For a particular message type, ROS 1's uuid_msgs/UniqueID vs ROS 2's unique_identifier_msgs/UUID, the message definition is exacly the same but type name is not.
  The only mapping fule defined in for unique_identifier_msgs/UUID is that it maps to uuid_msgs/UniqueID, but no field mappings are needed because the definitions are the same.
  But, then we hit the early return (because the for-loop is ran without any rule applying to the message at hand and thus not `continue`-ing in a code branch handling a rule)
  and return without applying the normal automatic field mapping generation rules.
  By removing the early return, the other rules are applied and the mapping rules for handling the exact same message defintions are applied
  * Account for fields mapped by rules when checking for missed fields
  The code after the early return mentioned in the previous commit assumed all fields would match by name,
  which was of course true. But not anymore, so the missing check now only fails when the missing fields are also not already accounted for via a mapping

* Suppress warning when packages aren't available (#355)
  * Suppress warning when packages aren't available
  ROS1 packages aren't available on all platforms.  In order to keep
  ros1_bridge in ros2.repos without warnings turning CI yellow, we need to
  suppress this warning.
* Make sure to use fully-qualified boost placeholders. (#351)
  Also make sure to declare a direct dependency on boost.
  While we are always getting it from ROS 1, this code directly
  uses it and so should also declare a dependency.
* 0.10.3
* Changelog
* Cleanup of README.md (#342)
  * Reformatted README.md
  This is an initial cleanup attempt of the README.md file.  All
  non-code lines have been wrapped to an 80 column width, and some
  markdown was cleaned up.  Further work is needed.
  * Added 'bash' info string to appropriate fenced code blocks.
  Numerous fenced code blocks did not have a
  [info string](https://github.github.com/gfm/#info-string), which
  meant that the enclosed code block wouldn't be rendered correctly.
  As it turned out, all of these were intended to be run in a bash
  shell, so I added that as their info strings.
  * WIP: Updated the scripts in the README.md file to use environment variables.
  The scripts weren't directly executable before, requiring manual
  substitution of various 'variables'.  This was unfortunate as Github
  makes copying and pasting code blocks simple and straightforward.
  The changes in this commit make it possible to copy/paste each example
  into it's own shell, which should make it slightly easier for new users
  to start using the bridge.
  * fix: Unwrapped lines per request from @gbiggs.
  @gbiggs commented at https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/pull/342#issuecomment-1029508012
  that files in ROS2 are intentionally not wrapped to make handling
  diffs in PRs easier.  I've copied in the relevant original lines
  to unwrap the lines I wrapped earlier.
